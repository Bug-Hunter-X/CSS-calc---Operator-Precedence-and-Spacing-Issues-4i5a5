The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence.  For instance, if you intend to calculate `100% - 50px`, but write `width: calc(100% - 50px);`, the browser might interpret this as `(100% - 50)px` instead of `100% - 50px`, leading to incorrect width calculations.  Similarly, forgetting to include spaces around operators can cause unexpected behavior.
